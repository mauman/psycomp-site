### Mindfulness scenarios for Chemiotherapy Patients
A multimodal, interactive VR scenario for interactive mindfulness practice in Virtual Reality. We are investigating how actively exploring and manipulating the guided imagery flow through their actions (e.g., grasping and throwing a thought at sea) affects patients' mindfulness experience.

### Radial Arm Maze in VR
We are developing novel digital tools in Virtual Reality to "gamify" the Radial Arm Maze task, allowing researchers to conduct the test in any physical space, extending the possibilities of personalizing the test, and improving the taskâ€™s speed of execution and result accuracy.
